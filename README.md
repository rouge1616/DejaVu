# DejaVu
Code and data for realistic intraoperative physics-based simulations for surgery

## Description

**DejaVu** is a surgical simulation framework built on the SOFA (Simulation Open Framework Architecture) platform. It enables high-fidelity, real-time simulation of patient-specific anatomies and surgical scenarios. Designed for researchers, clinicians, and educators, it supports deformable tissue modeling, interactive tool dynamics, and integration with medical imaging data.

- Real-time interaction and collision response  
- Supports soft tissue cutting and deformation  
- Integrates seamlessly with MRI/CT imaging  
- Easily extensible with custom plugins and scenes

## Installation of SOFA

To install the SOFA framework, follow the [official installation guide](https://www.sofa-framework.org/download/) for instructions tailored to your OS.

The scenes are plugin-free and use SOFA core modules, so you should be good to go.
