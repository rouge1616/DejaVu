## Description

**DejaVu** is a surgical simulation tool for intra-operative gesture rehearsal based on the SOFA framework. It bridges pre-op simulation and intra-op augmented reality by using real-time physical modeling and intra-operative images to deliver visually accurate, interactive organ simulations for grasping, pulling, and cutting.

It has also been successfully used for generating training data for deep learning models and as ground-truth to validate elastic registration or 3D reconstruction methods

## Installation of SOFA

To install the SOFA framework, follow the [official installation guide](https://www.sofa-framework.org/download/) for instructions tailored to your OS.
The scenes are plugin-free and use SOFA core modules, so you should be good to go.
